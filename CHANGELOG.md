# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Keep the `## [Unreleased]` section up to date **as part of every change** (the
same rule as the rest of the docs). At release time `npm run release X.Y.Z`
promotes this section to `## [X.Y.Z]` and the Release workflow publishes it
verbatim as the GitHub Release notes — so what you write here is what ships.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The admin dashboard now shows each feed's email count on its **Emails** button
  and a **"Last email …"** freshness line under the feed title, in both the list
  and table views. Both values are projected into `feeds:list`, so the dashboard
  stays a single KV read; they backfill on a feed's next email or save.

### Fixed

- Per-feed favicons now resolve for senders on a subdomain that hosts no icon of
  its own (e.g. `mail.example.com`): the lookup walks up to the apex domain
  (`example.com`) and uses its favicon, caching it under the original sender
  domain. Previously both the direct `/favicon.ico` and the DuckDuckGo lookup
  were tried only against the full subdomain, leaving such feeds blank.
- Subscription-confirmation detection now flags code-based signup verifications
  (OTP) that have no link to click — e.g. "Your verification code is 371404",
  whose only link is a `mailto:` support address. These cleared the keyword
  threshold but were dropped because the detector required an http(s) candidate
  link. A code path now raises the flag/badge/banner when a verification keyword
  sits next to an OTP-style code; the code itself is never extracted or surfaced.
- Subscription-confirmation detection now recognizes localized "subscribe" CTAs.
  The weak link-signal vocabulary was English-only (`subscrib`),
  so a genuine double opt-in whose confirm button reads "Je m'inscris…" over an
  opaque tracking redirect scored 0 on every link and was missed. The weak vocab
  is now multilingual (FR/DE/ES) to match the confirmation keywords.
- Per-feed favicons no longer fail for senders whose DuckDuckGo icon is a
  hi-res PNG: the maximum accepted favicon size is raised from 100 KB to 256 KB,
  so legitimate large icons (~107 KB and up) are cached instead of rejected.
  A domain that was already negatively cached only re-fetches once that entry's
  TTL expires (and something — a new email or a favicon request — retriggers
  the fetch); delete its `icon:<domain>` KV key to force an immediate refresh.
- Admin dashboard table view: long feed titles no longer overflow into the Feed
  ID column — the title/description cell now shrinks so its text ellipsises.
- RSS and Atom feeds now advertise the WebSub hub inside the feed body
  (`<atom:link rel="hub">`), not just in the HTTP `Link` header. Readers like
  FreshRSS discover the hub from the XML, so they can now subscribe and receive
  an instant push when a new email arrives instead of waiting up to the cache
  `max-age` (30 min) to refresh.
- Subscription-confirmation detection now recognises a confirm email whose CTA
  button carries the subscribe/subscription hint only in its visible text (e.g.
  "Yes, subscribe me to this mailing list.") over an opaque tracking-redirect
  href — previously the link scored zero and the email was missed.
- Sender favicons now recover from a transient miss: a failed favicon lookup is
  cached negatively for 6 hours instead of a full week, so a domain whose icon
  was momentarily unavailable (e.g. not yet indexed upstream) is retried on the
  next email instead of staying blank for days.
- Feed entry HTML now escapes bare ampersands in attribute URLs (e.g. query
  strings like `?a=1&b=2`), clearing the W3C feed validator's "Named entity
  expected. Got none." warning and improving interoperability with stricter
  feed readers.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-25

### Fixed

- Feed self link (RSS/Atom/JSON) is derived from the configured domain instead
  of the request host — it no longer leaks the `workers.dev` host when a feed is
  reached directly, and now matches the alternate link.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-25

### Added

- **Native feed detection** — incoming newsletters are inspected for a
  self-advertised Atom/RSS/JSON feed (`rel=alternate` links in the email HTML);
  discovered feeds are stored per sender on the Feed aggregate and surfaced as
  chips on the feed detail page, a dashboard pill, and (read-only) on the REST
  `Feed` schema, with a dismissable notice.
- **Subscription confirmation surfacing** — confirmation emails ("click to
  confirm your subscription") are detected at ingestion and flagged on the feed;
  the admin UI surfaces the confirmation link, a badge, a dashboard pill, and an
  inline banner (all dismissable), tightened against false positives via a
  weak-signal heuristic.
- **JSON Feed 1.1** output (`/json/:feedId`).
- **OPML export** of all feeds (`/admin/opml`).
- **Conditional GET** (ETag / Last-Modified / 304) on the feed routes.
- Per-feed **Subscribe chips** for RSS/Atom/JSON with copy / open / validate
  actions, reused across dashboard and feed detail page.
- Email detail page links to its public entry page; land on the feed's emails
  page right after creation.
- Optional **per-feed "sender in title"** toggle.
- Running **version** shown in the admin/status footer, `/health`, and
  `/api/v1/stats`.

### Changed

- **Read/write identity decoupling (privacy)** — the public read id (`FeedId`,
  used in `/rss/:feedId`) is fully decoupled from the inbound email address
  (`MailboxId`, `noun.noun.NN`); a feed's read URL never reveals its inbound
  alias and vice-versa (reading `/rss/<noun.noun.NN>` 404s).
- Sender display name, site URL and parsing now owned by the `EmailAddress`
  value object (DDD cleanup).
- Release version is derived from the git tag; CI guards against tagging the
  wrong commit.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-24

### Added

- Optional `FALLBACK_FORWARD_ADDRESS`: forward non-feed mail to a verified
  address so a domain catch-all can point at kill-the-news without swallowing
  personal mail (forwarded mail is counted in the stats dashboard).

### Changed

- Feed, entry, and attachment responses send `X-Robots-Tag: noindex`; a new
  `/robots.txt` disallows `/rss`, `/atom`, `/entries`, `/files`, and `/admin` —
  private feeds and emails stay out of search engines.
- Relative links/images in email bodies are absolutized against the sender's
  site; lazy-loaded images are promoted so they don't render blank.
- Feed `<title>` is plain text (HTML stripped, entities decoded).
- Sender-site derivation moved onto the `EmailAddress` value object
  (`siteBaseUrl`).

### Fixed

- XML-illegal control characters are stripped from generated feeds (valid astral
  characters such as emoji preserved).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-24

### Added

- Versioned REST API (`/api/v1/feeds*`) with an OpenAPI 3.1 spec
  (`/api/openapi.json`) and rendered reference docs via Scalar (`/api/docs`).
- `/api/v1/stats` as the canonical public stats endpoint (JSON + CORS).
- Optional R2 attachment storage with a config toggle, storage metrics, download
  links on the email/admin views, and inline `cid:` image rendering.
- Project favicon (`/favicon.svg`, `/favicon.ico`) and per-feed favicon derived
  from the last sender's domain (`/favicon/:feedId`).
- RFC 8058 one-click unsubscribe dispatched when a feed is deleted.

### Changed

- Large internal refactor toward a clean domain-driven architecture; redesigned
  landing/status page.

### Removed

- The deprecated `/api/stats` endpoint (use `/api/v1/stats`).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added

- **Atom feed format** (`/atom/:feedId`) alongside RSS 2.0.
- **WebSub push notifications** advertised via `Link` header for real-time
  delivery instead of polling.
- **HTML email processing** — bodies sanitized via `linkedom` + `escape-html`
  (XSS prevention, MSO style stripping, plain-text fallback).
- **Email attachments as RSS enclosures**, stored in R2 and served at
  `/files/:attachmentId/:filename`.
- **Sender blocklist** with 4-level priority matching and a quick-add dropdown.
- **`EMAIL_DOMAIN`** env var to separate web domain and email domain.
- **Authelia / reverse-proxy auth** via trusted headers (`Remote-User`,
  `X-Forwarded-User`).
- Demo environment auto-deployed to `demo.kill-the.news` with a nightly KV
  reset.
- Admin UI redesign (Inter font, orange theme), client scripts compiled via
  esbuild, templates on `hono/jsx`.
